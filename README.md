# UK-Rail-Prediction
🚆 UK Rail Delays Analysis Using Power BI 📊

Train delays are a common challenge in the UK, affecting passengers and railway operators. To gain insights into the causes of delays and their patterns, I built a Power BI dashboard analyzing real train delay datasets!

🔍 Project Overview:

✅ Cleaned and processed real-world train delay data.
✅ Created interactive Power BI visualizations for insights.
✅ Analyzed the impact of weather, congestion, and time factors on delays.

🚆 Key Insights from the Data

📌 Trains experience the **highest delays during Night** (~94.78 min).

📌 The second highest delays occur during **Evening** (~93.54 min).

📌 **Foggy weather leads to the longest delays (~108.09 min).**

📌 This is slightly higher than delays in **Rainy weather** (~101.27 min).

📌 High congestion contributes to **~35.98%** of total delays.

📌 **Unexpected congestion impact:** The delay pattern does not strictly increase with congestion level.

📌 Average delay for **low congestion**: ~108.89 min

📌 Average delay for **medium congestion**: ~70.67 min

📌 Average delay for **high congestion**: ~100.87 min
